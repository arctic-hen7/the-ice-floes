# The Ice Floes

Typically, we're used to finding people's comments on things on their social media, but this is an alternative system that will index my own micro-thoughts on things, in a publicly-available and totally platform-agnostic manner.

This is *extremely* experimental right now, and may go absolutely nowhere, or I might end up linking it to multiple real social media platforms, centralized and decentralized, to create a central space from which my posts can be shared. For now, this acts as a public backend for my personal site that allows my short thoughts to be displayed on a single page.

This acts as a shortform companion to my blog, *The Arctic Circle*.

## Motd

As part of this repository, you will find `motd`, a file that I'm using as a radical habit enforcer. As a bit of background, as my life has become somewhat less morning-heavy over the last year, my ability to wake up on time has declined. So, I thought I may as well create a mechanism that forces me to wake up by displaying a persistent message on my personal website that I haven't if I don't make a commit to `motd` in this repository by the morning! I also use that file as a a *message of the day*, which is displayed on my blog as a thoughtful quote or the like for the day, which forces me to continually engage with my own online presence, rather than letting my blog slowly wither for months at a time. As for whether or not this will work, head over to my blog and see if there's a message telling you I haven't woken up at the right time today!
