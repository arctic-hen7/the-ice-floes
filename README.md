# The Ice Floes

Typically, we're used to finding people's comments on things on their social media, but this is an alternative system that will index my own micro-thoughts on things, in a publicly-available and totally platform-agnostic manner.

This is *extremely* experimental right now, and may go absolutely nowhere, or I might end up linking it to multiple real social media platforms, centralized and decentralized, to create a central space from which my posts can be shared. For now, this acts as a public backend for my personal site that allows my short thoughts to be displayed on a single page.

This acts as a shortform companion to my blog, *The Arctic Circle*.
